## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm **Avishka Chamod**,
an undergraduate software engineering student based in Sri Lanka. Passionate about coding and eager to learn new technologies!
## About Me

I am currently pursuing my degree in Software Engineering, with a strong passion for building modern, scalable, and user-friendly applications. My core interest lies in full-stack development, where I work with technologies such as React.js, Spring Boot, Java, and MySQL to design and develop complete solutions. Through my projects, I have gained valuable experience in system design, application architecture, and problem-solving, while continuously exploring new programming languages and frameworks to broaden my skill set.

In addition to software development, I am deeply focused on cloud technologies, with a particular emphasis on AWS and other major cloud service providers. My goal is to become a Cloud Expert, leveraging cloud-native solutions to create secure, reliable, and scalable systems that can meet the needs of modern applications. I am committed to continuous learning and growth, and I am always seeking opportunities to collaborate on innovative projects, contribute to impactful solutions, and gain hands-on experience in both cloud computing and full-stack engineering.
